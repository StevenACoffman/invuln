Vulnerability #1: GO-2021-0113
    Due to improper index calculation, an incorrectly formatted language tag can
    cause Parse to panic via an out of bounds read. If Parse is used to process
    untrusted user inputs, this may be used as a vector for a denial of service
    attack.

  Module: golang.org/x/text
    Found in: golang.org/x/text@v0.3.0

=== Informational ===

There are 2 vulnerabilities in modules that you require that are
neither imported nor called. You may not need to take any action.
See https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck for details.

Vulnerability #1: GO-2022-0969
    HTTP/2 server connections can hang forever waiting for a clean shutdown that
    was preempted by a fatal error. This condition can be exploited by a
    malicious client to cause a denial of service.

  Standard library
    Found in: net/http@go1.18
    Fixed in: net/http@go1.18.6

Vulnerability #2: GO-2020-0015
    An attacker could provide a single byte to a UTF16 decoder instantiated with
    UseBOM or ExpectBOM to trigger an infinite loop if the String function on
    the Decoder is called, or the Decoder is passed to transform.String. If used
    to parse user supplied input, this may be used as a denial of service
    vector.
