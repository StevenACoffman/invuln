Vulnerability #1: GO-2021-0265
    A maliciously crafted path can cause Get and other query
    functions to consume excessive amounts of CPU and time.
  More info: https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2021-0265
  Module: github.com/tidwall/gjson
    Found in: github.com/tidwall/gjson@v1.6.5

        github.com/tidwall/gjson.Result.Get


Vulnerability #2: GO-2021-0113
    Due to improper index calculation, an incorrectly formatted
    language tag can cause Parse to panic via an out of bounds read.
    If Parse is used to process untrusted user inputs, this may be
    used as a vector for a denial of service attack.
